# List of locations and permission checks where it is acceptable to fail
# Each entry is defined as consecutive lines separated by a blank line where the first line is a
# regular expression to match against the permission info string. The remaining lines are regular
# expressions to match against separate stack lines' location portion only
# (e.g. <bundle-name>(<location>)) as provided with the --debug option in the same order as listed.

# pdfbox actually catches AccessControlException and continue without caching any fonts
# since DDF doesn't care about the actual fonts as it only processes the metadata from pdf documents
# we can safely ignore not having access to fonts on the system
