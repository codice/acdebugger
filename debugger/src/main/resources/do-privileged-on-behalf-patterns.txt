# Sets of location regex strings for code known to perform a doPrivileged() block in
# the code on behalf of its caller by re-arranging the access control context.
#
# All of these are only considered if they are part of the boot domain or bundle-0.
#
# This allows us to correct the break location in the stack to account for these locations' callers.

# Subject.doAs() is designed to execute a privileged action with the added context of the subject,
# one is trying to do something as. It purposely retrieves the context at the point it is called
# and combines the subject's attached context. Een though it is retrieving the context from its
# caller to do that, that context is re-combined which sometimes ends up in a different context than
# if it hadn't been called. Marking it here allows us to still account for the caller on our stack
# and place the stack break after them.
